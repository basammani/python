## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
 A: Object-oriented means this language is based around objects (such as data) rather than functions, and high-level means it's easy for humans to understand.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
A: Because the things we call “variables” in Python are names which are bound to objects after they've been created 


Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
 A: Pros:-->It's Simple,It's Free, It's Easy to Use, It's Highly Compatible, It is Object-Oriented, It has Lots of Libraries, It has Built-in Data Structures, It's Widely Applicable

 Cons:-Poor Memory Efficiency. To make it simple for the developer, Python needs a lot of memory space; this can be a tad problematic if you want to develop apps where you need to optimize memory, Slow Speed, Database Access,Weak in Mobile Computing,Runtime Errors.

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
 A: artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning,

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
 A: Variables are the basic unit of storage in a programming language. These variables consist of a data type, the variable name, and the value to be assigned to the variable.Unless and until the variables are declared and initialized, they cannot be used in the program.

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
 A :username = input("Enter username:") 
     print("Username is: " + username)
      The input function reads a line from the console, converts it into a string, and returns it

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
 A :string data type

Q8. What is type casting?
 A: The conversion of one data type into the other data type

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
 A: YES, we can take more than one input from the user using single input() function. by using split () function.

Q10. What are keywords?
 A: Python keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes and can't be used for anything but those specific purposes.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
 A: not able use Keyword as variable

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
 A: Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
 A: By useing print statement

Q14. What are operators in Python?
 A: operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed.


Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
  A: /-->division(/) AND //--->intergral(//)

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
 A: print("iNeuron"*4)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
 A: num = int (input ("Enter any number "))
    if (num % 2) == 0: 
    print ("The number is even") 
    else: 
    print ("The Given number is odd")

Q18. What are boolean operator?
 A: evaluate to true or false, not operator needs one operand evaluating to true or false. Boolean operator returns true if both operands return true.
 
Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 =ture

0 and 0= false

True and False and True=ture(2)

1 or 0 or 0= 0(false)
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
 A: 1)if. 2)else. 3)elif.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
 A: allow to use conditional logic and execute code given certain conditions.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
 A: age = int(input("Enter the voter age = "))
    if age>=18:
        print("I can vote")
    else :
        print("I can't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
 A: list1 = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
    for num in list1:
 if num % 2 == 0:
        print(num, end=" ")

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
 A: num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
num3 = int(input("Enter third number: "))

if (num1 >= num2) and (num1 >= num3):
   largest = num1
elif (num2 >= num1) and (num2 >= num3):
   largest = num2
else:
   largest = num3

print("The largest number is", largest)

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
A  : a = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
b = []
for i in a:
    if i > 150:
        if i > 500:
            break
        continue
    if i % 5 == 0:
        b.append(i)
        
print(b)
